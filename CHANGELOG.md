# Change Log

All notable changes to Torah Chat will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0]

- **Edit API keys** — Configured providers now show a pencil (✎) button to change API keys without removing and reconfiguring

- **Ollama model detection** — App validates Ollama models exist locally at startup and in the model picker; missing models no longer cause 404 errors
- **Ollama status display** — Settings panel shows Ollama's actual status: "Ready", "No models" (with pull instructions), or "Not running"
