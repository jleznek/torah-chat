# Torah Chat — Development Conversation Log

A reconstructed timeline of the collaborative development session between a developer and GitHub Copilot (Claude Opus 4.6) that built, polished, and published the Torah Chat desktop application. This entire session took place on February 10, 2026 in VS Code.

---

## Starting Point

The project began as a working Electron app with a chat UI connected to Google Gemini and Sefaria's MCP servers. It supported multiple AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) but had only been run in development mode — never packaged for distribution.

---

## Exchange 1: Create an Installer

**You:** "Please make an installer with a standalone executable and all dependencies."

**Copilot:** Configured electron-builder in package.json with NSIS installer and portable executable targets. Set up app metadata (appId, productName, icon, file patterns). Ran `npm run dist:win` to build. Produced an ARM64 installer and portable exe in the `release/` directory.

**Result:** First working installer — `Torah Chat-Setup-1.0.0-arm64.exe` (~87 MB) and `Torah Chat-Portable-1.0.0-arm64.exe`.

---

## Exchange 2: Citations Not Linked with Ollama

**You:** "For some reason the citations are not hyperlinked, at least when using Ollama."

**Copilot:** Investigated and found the root cause: Ollama's local models don't support tool-calling, so unlike Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic, they can't call Sefaria's MCP tools and don't follow the system prompt's citation formatting instructions. The models output bare text references like "Genesis 1:1" instead of hyperlinked citations.

Built a `linkifyCitations()` function in `renderer.js` that auto-detects Sefaria text references using regex patterns for:
- Talmud tractates (Berakhot, Shabbat, Eruvin, etc. — all 63)
- Tanakh books (Genesis through Chronicles, including alternate names)
- Classical commentators (Rashi, Ramban, Rambam, Ibn Ezra, etc.)
- Other works (Shulchan Arukh, Mishneh Torah, Zohar, Pirkei Avot, etc.)

The function protects existing markdown links and code blocks from double-linking. Integrated it into `renderMarkdown()` so it runs on all AI output before parsing.

**Result:** All text references are now clickable links to Sefaria, regardless of which AI provider is used.

---

## Exchange 3: Print Freezes the App

**You:** "If I go to print the chat pane, and cancel the print, the app freezes for about thirty seconds."

**Copilot:** Diagnosed that `window.print()` is synchronous in Electron's renderer process. When the OS print dialog is cancelled, Electron blocks the entire UI thread for ~30 seconds. Moved printing to the main process using IPC — the renderer sends a `print-chat` message, and the main process handles it asynchronously with `webContents.print()`.

**Result:** No more freeze on cancel.

---

## Exchange 4: No Print Preview

**You:** "When going to print, the print dialog says 'this app doesn't support print preview.'"

**Copilot:** Electron's `webContents.print()` delegates to the OS print dialog, which doesn't include a preview in Electron. Switched approach to `printToPDF()` — generates a PDF file and opens it with `shell.openPath()` in the system's default PDF viewer, which provides full print preview.

**Result:** PDF opens in Edge with full preview, print, and save capabilities.

---

## Exchange 5: Don't Want External App

**You:** "I don't like having to have another app (Edge) to view and print the PDF."

**Copilot:** Redesigned the print flow to keep everything in-app:
1. Renderer builds a complete standalone HTML document from the chat messages with print-friendly CSS
2. Sends it to main process via IPC
3. Main process creates a hidden BrowserWindow, loads the HTML, calls `printToPDF()`
4. Saves the PDF to a temp file
5. Opens it in the app's existing `<webview>` pane

Chromium's built-in PDF viewer provides a toolbar with print, download, zoom, and page navigation — all within the app itself.

**Result:** Print preview now works entirely within the Torah Chat window. No external applications involved.

---

## Exchange 6: Taskbar Icon Missing

**You:** "Still no icon on the taskbar."

**Copilot:** Investigated and found multiple issues:
1. The ICO file only had a single size — Windows needs multiple sizes for different display contexts
2. The icon path resolution wasn't working correctly in both dev and packaged modes
3. In dev mode, Windows associates the taskbar icon with `electron.exe`, not the app

Fixes applied:
- Regenerated `assets/icon.ico` with 7 sizes (16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256px) by constructing the ICO binary format manually using the `sharp` library
- Updated `getAppIcon()` to try multiple paths and prefer ICO on Windows
- Added `setOverlayIcon()` for dev mode to provide visual branding on the taskbar

**You:** "Much better!"

**Result:** Proper icon display in dev mode (via overlay) and in packaged builds (embedded in .exe).

---

## Exchange 7: Add x64 Builds and Publish to GitHub

**You:** "I would like to create an x64 version as well, and then package and publish them on GitHub."

**Copilot:** Updated package.json build targets to produce both x64 and arm64 variants with distinct filenames:
- `Torah Chat-Setup-{version}-x64.exe` / `-arm64.exe`
- `Torah Chat-Portable-{version}-x64.exe` / `-arm64.exe`

Built all 4 executables. Created a git tag and pushed. Used `gh release create` to publish a GitHub release with release notes and all artifacts attached.

**Result:** Release published at `github.com/jleznek-MSFT/torah-chat/releases/tag/v1.0.0` with 4 executables.

---

## Exchange 8: Code Signing

**You:** "Can I sign the files?"

**Copilot:** Presented options (purchased CA cert, Azure Trusted Signing, self-signed, skip). You chose self-signed.

Created a code signing certificate using PowerShell:
```
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type CodeSigningCert -Subject "CN=Torah Chat, O=Sefaria"
```
Certificate created with thumbprint `E8D41E0D8817722F306BE7F30E9C092F5BEBE9FB`, expiring February 2029.

Configured electron-builder's `win.signtoolOptions` in package.json. Hit an issue: electron-builder's cached `signtool.exe` didn't include an ARM64 binary (ENOENT error). Fixed by copying the x64 `signtool.exe` to the ARM64 cache directory — ARM64 Windows runs x64 binaries via emulation.

Rebuilt all executables — all signed successfully. Verified signatures show "CN=Torah Chat, O=Sefaria" with SHA-256 signing and DigiCert timestamping.

**Result:** All executables are code-signed. Windows SmartScreen still shows a warning (expected for self-signed certs), but the signature proves files haven't been tampered with.

---

## Exchange 9: Version Bump and Re-release

**Copilot:** Noticed the artifacts had "1.0.0" in the filename but should be "1.1.0" given all the changes. Bumped version to 1.1.0 in package.json, rebuilt all executables, deleted the old release, and prepared to create a new one.

**You:** "Yes please."

**Copilot:** Rebuilt with v1.1.0, all signed. Created new release with correctly-named artifacts.

---

## Exchange 10: Publish to Personal GitHub Account

**You:** "Can we publish this to my other GitHub account, jleznek?"

**Copilot:** Checked `gh auth status` — only `jleznek-MSFT` was configured. Explained the situation and asked you to authenticate.

**You:** "I authenticated."

**Copilot:** Verified `jleznek` was now the active account. Used `gh repo create jleznek/torah-chat --public --source=. --remote=jleznek --push` to create the repo and push all code. Built fresh, tagged v1.1.0, and created a GitHub release with all 4 signed executables.

**Result:** Published at `github.com/jleznek/torah-chat/releases/tag/v1.1.0`.

---

## Exchange 11: Donate Link

**You:** "Don't hate me. I'd like to add a hyperlink on the bottom of the app to donate to Sefaria. https://www.sefaria.org/ways-to-give"

**Copilot:** Added a `#donate-bar` div after the rate-limit bar in `index.html` with a link to the Sefaria donation page. Styled it subtly with small muted text. The app's existing global click handler automatically opens it in the webview pane.

**You:** "Can you make the link blue so it stands out?"

**Copilot:** Changed the link color from `var(--text-light)` to `#1a73e8` (blue).

**Result:** Blue "Support Sefaria — Donate" link at the bottom of the app.

---

## Exchange 12: Update the README

**You:** "In the readme file, it only highlights using Gemini. Include the other providers and Ollama as well. A benefit of this app is that it supports various models both online and offline."

**Copilot:** Rewrote the README with:
- A provider comparison table showing all four providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) with models, API key requirements, and notes
- Updated "Getting Started" to mention choosing a provider and highlight Ollama's no-key-needed setup
- Updated "Requirements" to cover both cloud and local usage
- Added new features: in-app text viewer, print preview, citation auto-linking

Committed and pushed to `jleznek/torah-chat`.

---

## Exchange 13: Announcement and Development Story

**You:** "I'd like to do two things. Create an announcement I can use to introduce a community to this app, and also can we create a document which outlines our chat thread to show how we evolved this app?"

**Copilot:** Created two documents:
1. `ANNOUNCEMENT.md` — A community-ready post with feature highlights, download links, getting started guide, and a note about AI-assisted development
2. `DEVELOPMENT-STORY.md` — A narrative chronicle of the development phases

**You:** "I'd like to review them first."

**You:** "Can you save the announcement file as a word doc?"

**Copilot:** Installed the `docx` npm library and wrote a Node.js script to convert the markdown to a formatted Word document with headings, bold text, hyperlinks, and bullet lists. Saved as `ANNOUNCEMENT.docx`.

**You:** "Can you dump the entire chat thread we've had into a formatted word document?"

**Copilot:** Explained that I don't have access to the raw chat transcript, only the summarized context. Offered two options: (1) expand the DEVELOPMENT-STORY.md or (2) reconstruct a detailed "You said / I did" timeline.

**You:** "2"

**Result:** This document — a detailed reconstruction of every exchange in our development session, formatted and saved as a Word document.
